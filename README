Baleen provides binary serializers and parsers for [keratin](https://github.com/lfdoherty/keratin) objects using the [parsicle](https://github.com/lfdoherty/parsicle) binary-parser-generator.

[Minnow](https://github.com/lfdoherty/minnow) DB uses it for object persistence to disk and for transfer across TCP.
